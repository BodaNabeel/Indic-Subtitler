# Indic-Subtitler
Using Seamless M4T to subtitle indic

## Project Objective

The number of tools which are available in Indian languages to subitle audio and videos in Indian languages are almost none. Yet that shouldn't be the case, as now there are lot of open-source models supporting speech transcription in most of official Indian languages.  This tool can be useful for subtitling audios and videos like Indian cinemas for Media Industry in general.




## Project Feasability

Due to advent of new technologies like Meta's seamless M4T model and Whisper fine-tuned models, you can do speech transcription to transcribe audio's from source audio to source text. With this a Hindi audio can be transcribed to Hindi text for generating subtitles. Meta's seamless M4T model also supports translation which can take Hindi audio and generate subtitle in languages like English, French, Malayalam etc.
